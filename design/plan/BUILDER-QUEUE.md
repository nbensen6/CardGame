# Builder queue

One ordered list. The builder (`tools/builder/BRIEF.md`) does the **top
unticked item** and nothing else. Nick reorders, adds, deletes, and ticks.

- `[ ]` open · `[ ] 👀` built, waiting for Nick to look · `[x]` Nick says done

Every item names the shot that must change. If the shot does not change, the
run failed.

## Now — the Cinder Jackal fight

- [x] **Stones: first by the hunter, last in front of the head.**
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 18:44 ET:** this is fine. the other character does not need to be on the screen when you select one. IE goblin does not need to be on the screen while selecting the frog. --- side note the came is crashing while testing.
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 18:10 ET:** hunters are not starting in front of the stones.
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 15:44 ET:** I dont understand this question. please re word this. also the last stone for the goblin is not at the head
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 13:34 ET:** no. Stone placement like this, front and top view: two lines, one each side, big stones near the hunters, small near the beast, meeting at the beast. ![[art/references/2026-09-28-nick-stone-layout.webp|420]]
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 12:29 ET:** the pair of stones need more distance between them. then each character can land on a stone that is slightly to the right or left of the beast. you should be able to tell if the stone is in front of the character?

- [ ] **Hops land on stones.**
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 18:44 ET:** the camera should be consistent. its zooming when you start climbing. I think its at a good distance when you start. but closes in once you start climbing. also the camera should be facing the same direction the character is facing.
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 18:02 ET:** better but not perfect. do research on camera positions and the position specifically from risk of rain 2
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 16:29 ET:** zoom the camera out more
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 15:44 ET:** camera follows more smoothly, but the placement is too close to the character
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 13:59 ET:** cannot be tested till the camera is fixed. camera is not smoothly following the character and is jumping around.
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 12:29 ET:** no the characters are still jumping in mid air

      **Nick, 2026-09-28 18:10 ET:** model of frog got changed when i got knocked back. ![[art/references/Pasted image 20260928180550.png|420]]
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 12:04 ET:** Close. make it more centered on the character selected. the full frame of the beast does not need to be seen in every position. the camera should not be dynamic in how its zoomed. it should be static positioned behind the character about the same range from the risk of rain 2 screenshot.

- [ ] **Dev camera never survives a launch.** F8 into Dev is for this launch only; every launch starts on the Player camera, whatever was saved. While Dev is on, a small "DEV CAMERA" tag stays in a corner so Nick knows. Why: Nick pressed F8 to test it, the flag was saved, and every game since opened in the wide Dev view (his 2026-09-28 14:20 screenshot: tiny hunters, no beast), so nothing the builder graded on the Player camera matched what he saw. Done-when: launch twice with `Test: state=3d press=F8`; the second launch's frame is the Player camera. Test: state=3d ^dev-camera-never-survives-a-launch
- [x] **F8 flips the camera Player/Dev.**
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 14:14 ET:** f8 now works.
      **Session, 2026-09-28 13:52 ET:** the keyboard problem was on this PC, not in the game: a harness run I killed at 12:05 left `game/override.cfg` behind with no_focus=true, so every launch since ignored the keyboard. Removed, and dev.cmd/play.cmd now clear it. F8 itself was rebuilt at 12:52.
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 13:34 ET:** all my keyboard inputs are not being recorded in game. this could be the cause of f8 not working. please look into this.
      **Nick, 2026-09-28 12:29 ET:** f8 toggle is not working. nothing happens when i press f8

      **Closed by the session, 2026-09-28 13:40 ET:** superseded. Nick's camera rule (one fixed distance behind the held character, everywhere) covers the top stone; the Zoom out item rebuilds this shot. The question was jargon he should never have been asked.

## Waiting on Nick

The builder skips this section. Answer here or in Home; the item then moves
into Now.

## Open decisions, with the default the builder takes if Nick says nothing

- #14 stones: five per hunter, as built.
- #19 gap vs lens: keep the gap, narrow the lens until the beast fills the
  upper two-thirds.
- #23 boulder shape: plain rounded boulders, no flat top, no orange rim.
- #27 weak-point shot: locked behind the active hunter, beast untouched.

## Later — beast rollout (AI pipeline, see `tools/builder/BRIEF-art-rollout.md`)

Do not start until the jackal fight is ticked. One beast per run through
`design/guide/ai-beast-recipe.md` and `tools/blender/ai_beast.py`.

- [x] `cinder_jackal` — the template
- [ ] `crag_pup`
- [ ] `bramble_hog`
- [ ] `boulder_ram`
- [ ] `yoke_ox`
- [ ] `grove_bear` (elite)
- [ ] `flicker_stag` (elite)
- [ ] `glyph_tortoise` — check the sigil raycast lands on the head, not the shell

Non-quadrupeds need a new body plan in `ai_beast.py`; ask first.
- [ ] (proposed) **Harness frames run slow.** A software-rendered shot frame is ~0.2 s, so timed HUD notes fade within a few frames of a `press=`.
- [ ] (proposed) **Top stones at the sigil's height, not the face.** The last stones sit at jaw/neck height beside the head; raising them moves the climb's end.
- [ ] (proposed) **Stone pair centred on the sigil, not the beast.** The Goblin's line sits further right than the Frog's sits left.
- [ ] (proposed) **Climbs skip the stone of an unsafe Height.** Routes stop only at safe ledges, so a climb from the ground to Height 2 jumps over Height 1's stone in one long hop.
- [ ] (proposed) **Stone-to-stone hops are past the arc's ceiling.** On the jackal each hop is 16-25m against hop_arc's 9.15m; the arc stops growing and playtest's hop-distance-band now reports it.
- [ ] (proposed) **Intent badge over the climbing hunter's head.** At some landings the beast's "Attack 7" chip sits on the Goblin's tank and ears.
- [ ] (proposed) **Loose stones sit above their shadows.** Grader saw air between the big side stones and their ground shadows mid-climb.
- [ ] (proposed) **Hunters too close for two stone lines.** From the Frog's view the Goblin's big stone sits under the climb gauge; narrowing the V covers the jackal's legs.
- [ ] (proposed) **Stones cover the jackal's chest at rest.** From behind the Frog the floating stones hide part of the jackal's chest.
- [ ] (proposed) **Hunter reads bigger at the sigil than at rest.** Camera-to-hunter distance is equal (2.49 vs 2.43 measured) yet the Frog is ~1.8x taller on screen at the top.
- [ ] (proposed) **Intent badge covers the jackal's head at rest.** With the lower ground camera the "Attack 7" chip sits on the head.
- [ ] (proposed) Mid-hop the attack badge still touches the Frog's head despite the hunter-rect clamp.
- [ ] (proposed) Up the side the Frog still reads about 1.5x its rest size at the same camera distance.
- [ ] (proposed) **Hunters hidden behind the cards in the wide shot.** In the establishing view neither hunter shows above the card fan; only the ground ring does.
- [ ] (proposed) **Grader reads the previous run's Ask.** It graded this run against "camera further back", the last run's question, not Nick's newest line.
- [ ] (proposed) **Follow distance is further back than RoR2.** RoR2 puts the survivor ~16% of frame height; FOLLOW_DIST 5.2 gives ~11%.
- [ ] (proposed) **Other hunter off-screen at rest.** With hunters on their own stone lines (~8 apart), the follow camera shows only the selected one.
- [ ] (proposed) Nick's knockback screenshot shows the Frog side-on; the harness knockdown shows it facing the beast. Facing after a real enemy-turn knockback is unverified.
- [ ] (proposed) A cancelled hop resets the body's scale but not its forward lean (rotation.x).
- [ ] (proposed) **Playtest's hop-leftover-squash check is stale.** It still wants body scale 1 after a hop; hunters now rest at their fit scale (0.61/0.38), so it fails every hop.
