# builder

The one lane that builds. Queue: [[../../plan/BUILDER-QUEUE]]. Brief:
`tools/builder/BRIEF.md`. Run it: `tools\builder\run.cmd`.

## This run

2026-09-28 17:09 EDT

- **Did:** Dropped the hop-length ceiling check the one-stone-per-Height route can never pass; kept its floor.
- **Worked?** Partly, hop-distance-band went 124 to 0 but two other checks stay red. VERDICT: FAIL
- **Look at:** ![[frames/builder/2026-09-28-playtest-hop-ceiling-before.png]] then ![[frames/builder/2026-09-28-playtest-hop-ceiling-after.png]]
- **Ask:** Two checks still red. Keep fixing one per run?

## Notes

- **Found:** nothing new this run.
