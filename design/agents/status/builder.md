# builder

The one lane that builds. Queue: [[../../plan/BUILDER-QUEUE]]. Brief:
`tools/builder/BRIEF.md`. Run it: `tools\builder\run.cmd`.

## This run

2026-09-28 13:55 EDT

- **Did:** Every climb hop now lands on its own stone; long legs no longer split into mid-air landings.
- **Worked?** Yes: all eight landings of a full climb, both hunters, stand on stones. `VERDICT: PASS`
- **Look at:** ![[frames/builder/2026-09-28-hops-land-strip-before.png]] then ![[frames/builder/2026-09-28-hops-land-strip-after.png]]
- **Ask:** Play one climb: does any hop still float?

## Notes

- **Found:** climbs stop only at safe ledges, so ground to Height 2 jumps over Height 1's stone in one hop.
- **Found:** stone-to-stone hops are 16-25m, past hop_arc's 9.15m ceiling; playtest's hop-distance-band now reports them.
- **Found:** the grader saw the intent chip sitting on the Goblin's head at some landings.

## Log

- 2026-09-28 13:55 EDT — builder: one hop per stone (climb_landings), no mid-air sub-landings; harness land=K; grader FAIL then PASS; tested, pushed.

- 2026-09-28 13:11 EDT — builder: stone lines split one each side of the jackal (route_offset_x, 4 hunters each side); grader FAIL then PASS; tested, pushed.

- 2026-09-28 12:24 EDT — builder: one fixed follow distance (3.2) behind the held hunter, centred, yaw on the beast-to-hunter line; grader FAIL on side-on Frog; tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-27 18:39 EDT — builder: the first climb engages the locked follow camera; hunter-offscreen 4 fails to 0; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-27 18:24 EDT — builder: camera-not-over-shoulder waits for the truck's ease instead of 45 frames; 9 fails to 0; built, tested, pushed.

- 2026-09-25 18:27 EDT — builder: playtest.cmd green -- fixed hunter-off-marker's stale side + a guard-cap bail that read `home` mid-tween; 7 failing categories down to 6; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-25 18:02 EDT — builder: investigated weak-point-shot Switch behaviour, already correct in every path tried, no change shipped, item left open.
- 2026-09-25 17:52 EDT — builder: playtest's own top-hold z now hull-corrected like the real route, not the raw anchor; tested, pushed.
