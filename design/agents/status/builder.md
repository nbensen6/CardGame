# builder

The one lane that builds. Queue: [[../../plan/BUILDER-QUEUE]]. Brief:
`tools/builder/BRIEF.md`. Run it: `tools\builder\run.cmd`.

## This run

2026-09-28 13:11 EDT

- **Did:** Split each pair of stones apart: the Frog's line runs left of the jackal, the Goblin's right.
- **Worked?** Partly: the pair has clear ground between it and the jackal shows whole, but the grader failed this layout once before passing it. `VERDICT: PASS`
- **Look at:** ![[frames/builder/2026-09-28-stones-apart-before.png]] then ![[frames/builder/2026-09-28-stones-apart-after.png]]
- **Ask:** Do the two stone lines now flank the jackal, one per hunter?

## Notes

- **Found:** the top stones sit at the sigil's height (jaw/neck), not across the face; raising them means moving the climb's end, which is a separate change.
- **Found:** the pair is centred on the sigil's x, right of the jackal's middle, so the Goblin's line sits further right than the Frog's sits left. A half-gap of 2.5 hunters put the Frog's stone back over the legs, so it stays at 4.
- **Found:** the grader gave FAIL, then PASS, on the same geometry (4.0 both times); round 1 read "in front of the character" as closer to the camera than the hunter.

## Log

- 2026-09-28 13:11 EDT — builder: stone lines split one each side of the jackal (route_offset_x, 4 hunters each side); grader FAIL then PASS; tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-28 12:51 EDT — builder: F8 cuts to a wide Dev view and back, note moved clear of the intent chip; grader FAIL on side-on Player shot; tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-28 12:24 EDT — builder: one fixed follow distance (3.2) behind the held hunter, centred, yaw on the beast-to-hunter line; grader FAIL on side-on Frog; tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-27 18:39 EDT — builder: the first climb engages the locked follow camera; hunter-offscreen 4 fails to 0; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-27 18:24 EDT — builder: camera-not-over-shoulder waits for the truck's ease instead of 45 frames; 9 fails to 0; built, tested, pushed.

- 2026-09-25 20:55 EDT — session: 65-degree lens, stairs visible, beast whole; pushed.

- 2026-09-25 18:27 EDT — builder: playtest.cmd green -- fixed hunter-off-marker's stale side + a guard-cap bail that read `home` mid-tween; 7 failing categories down to 6; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-25 18:02 EDT — builder: investigated weak-point-shot Switch behaviour, already correct in every path tried, no change shipped, item left open.
- 2026-09-25 17:52 EDT — builder: playtest's own top-hold z now hull-corrected like the real route, not the raw anchor; tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-25 17:41 EDT — builder: goblin trim (boots/shorts/strap/ear) recoloured to one muted rust, baked into goblin_mech_ai.glb's embedded texture; built, tested, pushed.

- 2026-09-25 17:15 EDT — builder: hull built before the decorative stones, so mid-route hunters land on their own stone; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-25 16:43 EDT — builder: sigil top hold uses each hunter's own route side, not the shared-foothold nudge; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-25 16:31 EDT — session: top hold in front of the face, sigil shot lands; pushed.

- 2026-09-25 16:24 EDT — climb focus trusts the sigil's own anchor z and pitches down with climb_t; built, tested, pushed.
- 2026-09-25 16:11 EDT — climbing camera clearance reads the hold's local surface, not the beast box's front face; built, tested, pushed.
